.SYNOPSIS 
    Deploys and configures the Microsoft SDN infrastructure, 
    including creation of the network controller, Software Load Balancer MUX 
    and gateway VMs.  Then the VMs and Hyper-V hosts are configured to be 
    used by the Network Controller.  When this script completes the SDN 
    infrastructure is ready to be fully used for workload deployments.
.EXAMPLE
    .\SDNExpress.ps1 -ConfigurationDataFile .\MyConfig.psd1
    Reads in the configuration from a PSD1 file that contains a hash table 
    of settings data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\SDNExpress -ConfigurationData $MyConfigurationData
    Uses the hash table that is passed in as the configuration data.  This 
    parameter set is useful when programatically generating the 
    configuration data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\SDNExpress 
    Displays a user interface for interactively defining the configuraiton 
    data.  At the end you have the option to save as a configuration file
    before deploying.
.NOTES
    Prerequisites:
    * All Hyper-V hosts must have Hyper-V enabled and the Virtual Switch 
    already created.
    * All Hyper-V hosts must be joined to Active Directory.
    * The physical network must be preconfigured for the necessary subnets and 
    VLANs as defined in the configuration data.
    * The VHD specified in the configuration data must be reachable from the 
    computer where this script is run.
